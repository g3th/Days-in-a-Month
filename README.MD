# Days-in-a-month calculator
## Finds how many days a month has for a particular year

Enter a year and a month, and the program will tell you how many days that month has for the current year. 

This means that if February is chosen for a leap-year, the program will return 29 days.

Therefore, this program is also able to discern whether a year is a leap-year or not.
